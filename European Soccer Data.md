# European Soccer Data Preparation and Analysis

## Introduction

This portfolio showcases my skills in using SQL queries to perform complex data manipulation and analysis. The objective of this project is to demonstrate my ability to work with SQL databases, clean and prepare data, perform exploratory data analysis, and generate meaningful insights. This project focuses on analysing European soccer data to gain insight into team performance, player statistics, and predict match outcomes.

## 1. Data Import and Database Setup
The tools I use is microsoft sql server and it is managed by 

In this section, we import the dataset into an SQL database and set up the database schema. We describe the dataset and explain the process of importing the data into the database.

## 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation

This section focuses on cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis. We identify and handle missing values, remove duplicate records, and perform data validation and quality checks.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

Here, we explore the dataset using SQL queries to gain insights and understand the data better. We calculate descriptive statistics, aggregate and summarize data, and visualize the results using appropriate charts and graphs.

## 4. Complex Data Manipulation

This section demonstrates advanced SQL techniques for complex data manipulation. We work with subqueries, joins, and table relationships to extract meaningful information from the data.

## 5. Reporting and Visualization

In this section, we generate comprehensive reports and create interactive dashboards using SQL queries and visualization tools. We present the key findings and insights from the data analysis.

## 6. Conclusion

The conclusion provides a summary of the achievements in this portfolio project. We highlight the lessons learned during the process and suggest future enhancements or areas for further exploration.

## 7. Appendix

The appendix includes SQL code snippets, a database schema diagram, and references used in this project.
