## 1. Introduction

This portfolio showcases my skills in using SQL queries to perform complex data manipulation and analysis. The objective of this project is to demonstrate my ability to work with SQL databases, clean and prepare data, perform exploratory data analysis, and generate meaningful insights. 
This project focuses on analyzing European soccer data to gain insight into team performance, player statistics, and predict match outcomes.

## 2. Data Description and Preparation
The dataset that I am using is the european soccer data set obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer)

| Table Name         | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Country            | Contains country id  and country name |
| Leagues            | Contains league id and league name for each country |
| Matches            | Contains details about each match such as team, player, and score |
| Players            | Includes data on individual players such as birthday, height, and weight |
| Player_Attributes  | Includes various player assessment metrics, such as the overall rating. |
| Teams              | Provides information about the teams |
| Team_Attributes    | Provides various team assessment metrics |

Data Description and Preparation:

Describe the European soccer dataset and its tables.
Discuss the attributes of each table.
Explain any data preprocessing steps required, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing data validation and quality checks.
Import the European soccer data into the database and discuss the process.
Database Design:

Define the database schema for the project.
Identify the necessary tables and their relationships.
Discuss the primary and foreign keys.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Explore the dataset using SQL queries to gain insights and understand the data better.
- Calculate descriptive statistics, aggregate and summarize data.
- Visualize the results using appropriate charts and graphs.

## 4. Data Analysis and Complex Data Manipulation
- Present the results of your SQL queries.
- Provide visualizations or summaries to enhance understanding.
- Interpret and discuss the insights and patterns you discovered.
- Demonstrate advanced SQL techniques for complex data manipulation.
- Work with subqueries, joins, and table relationships to extract meaningful information from the data.
- Showcase more complex SQL queries developed.
- Explore additional analysis or insights beyond the basic queries.

## 5. Reporting and Visualization
- Generate comprehensive reports and create interactive dashboards using SQL queries and visualization tools.
- Present the key findings and insights from the data analysis.

## 6. Conclusion
- Summarize the project and its accomplishments.
- Reflect on the insights gained and their implications.
- Discuss the strengths and limitations of your analysis.
- Highlight the lessons learned during the process and suggest future enhancements or areas for further exploration.


## 7. Appendix

The appendix includes SQL code snippets, a database schema diagram, and references used in this project.
